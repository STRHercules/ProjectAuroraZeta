## 2025-12-16 — Boss interval + size cap

**Prompt / Task**
- A giant Boss spawns on Wave 20, they should spawn every 20 Waves. Cap boss scale to avoid massive sprites at high waves.

**What Changed**
- Added boss interval + max size config, repeated boss spawns every 20 waves.
- Clamped boss visual size to prevent runaway scaling.
- Exposed interval/maxSize in gameplay config; documented in GAME_SPEC.
- Bumped build string to v0.0.103.

**Steps Taken**
- Updated WaveSystem to track next boss wave and cap boss size.
- Threaded new boss interval/maxSize settings through Game config load and WaveSystem setup.
- Updated gameplay.json defaults and GAME_SPEC milestone description.
- Built target `game`.

**Rationale / Tradeoffs**
- Interval handled in wave system to stay authoritative to spawn logic.
- Size cap applied at render/creation point to preserve hitboxes with consistent proportions.
- Max size default (110u) chosen to keep sprites readable while still larger than elites.

**Build / Test**
- Build: `cmake --build build --target game -- -j4` (Linux, 2025-12-16) — success.
- Manual: not run (scope limited to spawn logic/config update).
