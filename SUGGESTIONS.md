## 2025-12-16 — Suggestions after Boss interval + size cap
- Add UI banner text that names boss wave numbers when repeating (e.g., "Wave 40 Boss") for clarity.
- Consider scaling boss HP with interval count (e.g., +X% each milestone) separately from regular wave scaling to keep pace with player power.
- Add config-driven per-boss archetype overrides to vary visuals/attacks on later milestones.
