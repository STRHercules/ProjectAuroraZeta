## 1. Setting & Tone

| Aspect           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visual Style** | Neon-flecked hard-sci-fi with grime: think *The Expanse* meets *Hades*. Smooth isometric camera, exaggerated VFX for readability, holographic UI overlays.                                                  |
| **Lore Hook**    | The Warp Gates are actually half-functioning *interstellar prison routers*. Zeta’s “storms” are periodic dimensional bleeds that spawn abominations—handy excuse for wave escalation and weird boss biomes. |
| **Humor Level**  | Darkly cheeky. In-game AI announcer has a dry sense of humor (“Congratulations, Inmate #03894-B. You lived six seconds longer than average!”).                                                              |

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Briefing & Load-out (2 min)**

   * Squad votes on difficulty, map variant, and optional mutators (e.g., “Double Boss HP but +50% currency”).
   * Pick hero → pick a *Career Perk* (persistent talent) → optional vanity skins deducted from kill totals.

2. **Crash-Drop Intro (30 sec)**

   * Ship plummets, clamps pop, gear crates explode outward (tutorial pop-ups if first game).

3. **Wave Phases (\~2 min each)**

   * *Combat (90 sec)*: mow, kite, heal, scream.
   * *Intermission (30 sec)*: buy items, allocate skill points, reposition.

4. **Mini-Event** (every 5 waves)

   * Escort a crippled mech, defend a “data siphon,” assassinate elite spawners, or salvage a downed freighter for bonus currency.

5. **Milestone Boss**

   * Wave 20, 40, etc. Defeating it triggers a map-wide buff and explosive confetti of loot.

6. **End-State**

   * Hit target wave or squad wipe. Stats splash, kill totals banked, Talent Points awarded.

---

## 3. Camera & Controls

* **RTS-Lite**: WASD pans camera; mouse-wheel zooms; double-space centers on hero.
* **Hero Leash**: Optional toggle to keep hero locked center-screen (twin-stick vibe).
* **Tactical Ping Wheel**: Q holds radial menu—mark targets, call “Shop time,” etc.
* **Spectator Drones**: Dead players fly drones granting vision and mini-CC (EMP zap every 20 s) to keep them engaged until next respawn checkpoint.

## 4. Heroes & Progression

### 4.1 Archetypes & Sample Tier-1 Roster

| Class        | Hero (T1)    | Kit Highlights                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tank**     | *Bulwark*    | Magnetic shield dome (intercepts projectiles), “Taunt Pulse,” passive %-life regen.                        |
| **DPS**      | *Arcstriker* | Chain-lightning rifle, overheat mechanic (damage vs self-burn), dash that spews ion trail.                 |
| **Healer**   | *Nano-Nurse* | Cone heal that leaves HoT spores, revive speed boost, can overcharge to convert heals into DoT on enemies. |
| **Assassin** | *Wraith*     | Short-range cloak, backstab multiplier, teleport beacon recall.                                            |
| **Builder**  | *Wrench*     | Deploys turrets/drone swarms; scrap collection minigame gives discount.                                    |
| **Support**  | *Maestro*    | Aura songs (swap tracks for buff types), shockwave ultimate that scales with active allies.                |

*(Tier-2+ heroes unlock at milestone kill counts and add exotic mechanics like terrain morphing, time-dilation fields, or pet symbiotes.)*

### 4.2 In-Match Upgrades

* **Level Curve**: XP from kills/events → 3 ability ranks + 2 branching augments each.
* **Item Shop** (gold = kill currency):

  * **Core**: flat stats, lifesteal, cooldown reduction.
  * **Unique**: “Warp Displacer” (blink every 6 s), “Tesla Coil Boots” (zap on sprint), etc.
* **Evolve** (Wave 60+): trade gold + “phase shards” (boss drops) to transform hero into *EX form*—new ult, reskinned model.

### 4.3 Persistent Talent Tree

* **Three Tracks**: Offense, Defense, Utility.
* **Prestige**: Resets tree, grants +10% global XP and a shiny border around username (bragging rights).
* **Seasonal Mods**: Rotate every month—e.g., “Bio-Plague Season” adds toxins that slightly alter talent effects.

## 5. Enemies & Bosses

| Tier          | Example Enemy          | Gimmick                                                | Counterplay                                                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trash**     | *Skitterlings*         | Swarm in packs, low HP, explode on death.              | AOE; Tanks soak.                                                       |
| **Elite**     | *Warp Revenant*        | Phase shift every 5 s (invuln), fires piercing beams.  | Stagger hits to catch it “solid.”                                      |
| **Mini-Boss** | *Gravemind Root*       | Static plant spawner that buffs allies.                | Prioritize kill, avoid root pull.                                      |
| **Mega-Boss** | *Star-Eater Leviathan* | Multi-segmented body circles map, weak spots light up. | Team splits to hit segments simultaneously; Builders drop slow fields. |

* **Adaptive Director**: AI increases spawn composition based on squad performance—too many snipers → spawn shielded chargers.

* **Daily Challenge**: Pre-set modifiers, global leaderboard for bragging rights (and a flashy banner skin).

---

## 7. Maps & Hotzones

### 7.1 Core Layout

* **Five Hotzones** (center + mid-edges) rotate active bonus every 60 s:

  * **XP Surge** (+25% XP)
  * **Danger-Pay** (+50% gold)
  * **Warp Flux** (random buff but spawns extra elites)
* Traversal hazards: collapsible bridges, lava vents, fog pockets that disable radar.
* Environmental assists: hackable turrets, shield pylons that grant overshield while nearby.

### 7.2 Variants

1. **The Shattered Plains** – Wide open, minimal cover, big line-of-sight.
2. **Orbital Wreckyard** – Tight corridors, conveyor belts that drag units.
3. **Crystal Caverns** – Multi-level ramps; crystals amplify energy damage (both ways!).

## 8. Events & Side Objectives

| Event                   | Mechanics                                           | Reward                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **“Escort Duty”**       | Protect a non-combat escort walking 500–1200u; foes prioritize it. | Hefty gold payout on arrival. |
| **“Power Core Escort”** | Slow-moving core, enemies target it.                | XP + global damage buff 2 min.  |
| **“Bounty Hunt”**       | Elite hunter squad invades; names displayed on HUD. | Phase shard (for Evolves).      |

Optional participation—skipping spares resources for defense but forgoes sweet loot.

---

## 9. Quality-of-Life & Accessibility

* Colorblind mode (distinct silhouettes + hologram edges).
* Toggleable damage numbers / screen shake.
* One-handed control preset (camera auto-follows hero).
* “Chill Mode” (no timers, 0.6× enemy speed) earns reduced progress but keeps the vibes friendly.

---

## 10. Monetization & Cosmetics (Kill-Sink Economy)

* **Kill-Shop**: Legendary skins, VO packs, kill-fed pets.
* **Season Pass** uses *earned* kills instead of cash; premium track optional micro-purchase but *never* sells power.
* **Leaderboard Badges**: show total kills spent vs banked (flex your grind).

## 11. Technical & Backend

| Subsystem         | Approach                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| **Save System**   | AES-encrypted JSON blob, cloud-sync option.                                                            |
| **Matchmaking**   | P2P host-client for ≤ 4 players, relay server for 5-6.                                                 |
| **Modding Hooks** | Expose hero XML definitions & Lua scripts for community creations—curate via Steam Workshop-style hub. |

---

## 12. Future Expansions

* **New Hero Lines**: *Summoners*, *Time-Benders*, *Bio-Shifters*.
* **“Rogue-Lite Run”**: Branching arenas, permanent death, choose upgrades between rooms.
* **Warp Gate Expedition**: PvE-PvP race—two squads on mirrored maps sabotage each other via dimensional anomalies.
