# Gameplay Overview

## **Setting**

Viewstyle will be a Top Down, perhaps isometric viewing angle. Preferably a sci-fi setting, map-wise. Ability to zoom in and out, increasing or reducing field of view. Wave-based shoot-em-up. Similar camerastyle and control scheme to an RTS. Free moving camera, independent from unit movement.

## **Story**

### *Who are you?*

The year is 2355 and it has been hundreds of years since humanity stepped foot into the stars. Not long after that, everything changed. The discovery of the warp gates enabled us to travel further than we could ever imagine, it opened up so many paths we never thought possible. Historians, scientists, archeologists, you name it have studied the Warp Gates and yet nobody has any solid evidence as to where they came from, who built them or what they are even really for.

You awaken on a freighter, hands bound and mouth gagged, with only a fainlty foggy memory of how you got here.. oh yeah, you are a prisoner, it's all coming back now.

You look around and see 5 others bound in the small shuttle going through various stages of the same experiences you just had, and have a sudden horrific realization. This is a prisoner transport shuttle, and there is only one place these shuttles take prisoners.. 

### *Zeta*

Zeta is a horrible, yet absolutey stunning world we discovered only a few short decades after stretchig our space legs, and one of the very few planets that are banned by the Interplanetary Congresional Army, the same bastards that put you on this shuttle. Ironic. You hear the klaxon alarm sound and know what is coming, what we refer to as the ICA Landing. It's a crash.

### *Survival*

Hobbling out of the wreckage of your shuttle yours and your shipmates retraints magnetically unseal themselves, setting everyone free. The sides of the shuttle shoot off as if under pressure to reveal supplies - weapons, currency, etc and a second klaxon alarm sounds, this one far more ominous, because this one meant it was starting, and they *they* were coming. You know the only way to survive is to work together. Those who survive will have their sentences reduced, possibly even forgiven, and when humans live to be 300+ years old, a life sentence carries a lot more weight. I have to survive. I have to get off Zeta. We have to survive.

## *Rundown*

Game will start with 1-6 players, each selecting a unique hero/champion at the start of the round (they can switch mid-game) to fight continous waves of enemies. There will be many heroes to choose from ranging from a wide variety of play styles. From aggro absorbing tanks to high damage output glass cannons, to miniature base constructors, and stealth assassins. The player will have a career record kill count for each respective type (to encourage replayability). The overall kill counter will go towards things like unlocking milestones to gain access to stronger, more complex heroes of the respective category. i.e; You must have 100,000 overall kills with the Assault class in order to unlock the tier 2 Assault hero.

## *Core Mechanics*
- Multiple Hero Archetypes - (Tank, Healer, Dps, Assassin, Builder, etc)
- Multiple Enemy Types - (Fast/Weak, Strong/Slow, Ground, Flying, Ethereal, etc)
- Mini-Bosses and Mega-Bosses - (Mini-Bosses during small milestone waves like 20/Mega-Bosses at larger milestones like 100. Reward for completing boss kills will be a temporary boost for the remainder of the match - can miss the opportunity for reward if bosses despawn before dying)
- Scripted Events mid-game - (Escort missions, gathering, bounties, etc)
- Varied Difficulty settings - (Either selected prior to match start, or voted on by players upon match start)
- Persistent kill record - (Used to track access to stronger tier heroes)
- Resource Gathering - (Upgrading Heroes during the match will require money attained by getting kills)
- Hero Evolution - (Advanced versions of heroes after completing X Challenge)
- Hero Upgrading - (Upgrade a heroes abilities in-game upon leveling them up)
- Item Purchase from in-game Shop (To encourage different builds for the same hero, also uses an in-game currency earned for kills or Events)
- Persistent Talent Tree - (Attain Talent Points for each match played - varied depending on bosses eliminated, Events completed, overall kills obtained, round reached, etc)
- Prestiging - (Wipe current Talent Tree to start over with 10% boost to all stats?)
- Challenges - (Complete certain difficulties with certain heroes, with certain stipulations for rewards. i.e; Finish Hard with only Builders)

## *Objective*

Survive to the round of the selected difficulty, and optionally complete any Events that may arise, while also defeating the milestone Wave Bosses.

## *Replayability*

Persistent Kill Records, Talent Trees, Challenges and Hero Evolutions will ensure the replayability of the game. The milestones to unlock the next Hero can be significantly far away from each other. 

Also, continuous and consistent release of new and exciting heroes will be of the upmost importance, secondly perhaps new maps, challenges, or possibly even skins.

A premium in-game shop can exist outside of the in-game Shop that can provide player's the ability to purchase skins, and other customization options for their heroes and/or profiles at the permanent cost of their kills.

For example; Golden *TANK CHARACTER* skin for 10,000,000 kills permanently deducted from your account.

## *Persistence*

## *Map Design*
